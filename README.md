# Design of Water Level Indicator along with Automatic Water Pump Control System

The project is designed to give a display of water level in a tank and control a pump motor as required.

## Introduction

In accordance with the current scenario, a lot of water is wasted everyday from residential areas, offices and hospitals. Water is essential in various ways and such a huge amount of water wastage can lead to its scarcity in future. Nowadays everybody has overhead tank at their homes. Our objective is to indicate water level and control the water pump to avoid overflow of water. The idea can be implicitly used to ascertain and control the level of water in overhead tanks and prevent wastage. Microcontrollers offer better solution, being computers on single chips; enable production of embedded smart systems which are prevalent everywhere today. A designer just need to master it, learn their instruction sets and write codes that make them work. This project will allow the level of water in a tank to be maintained automatically, that is, unattended to; it uses Arduino microcontroller, codes were written in order for it to perform as water level controller.

## Componenets Required

All the required components are:

1. MICROCONTROLLER
2. LCD DISPLAY (16 Ã— 2)
3. ULTRASONIC SENSOR MODULE
4. RELAY (6 V)
5. BUZZER
6. ULN2003
7. MINI MOTOR PUMP
8. RESISTORS
9. LED INDICATORS
10. 9V BATTERY OR 12V ADAPTOR
11. VOLTAGE REGULATOR (7806)

## Working principle

This project is about water conservation which is the practice of using water efficiently to reduce unnecessary water usage and our motive is to do this job by using smart technology. If the tank is full then it will detect the situation by using ultrasonic sensor. And alert anyone by using buzzer. At first, we have to collect hardware. If the tank is full the ultrasonic sensor will activate. The LED will be off and the buzzer will work automatically. The motor will stop to save the water; water tank full, motor turned off will display on LCD screen. And in the second case if the tank is empty then the led will glow on the motor will start automatically; low water level, motor turned on will display on LCD screen. The buzzer will not work that time.
